Home Assistant (HASS) Addon to support the Waveshare PWM Controlled Fan HAT

Important: Enable I2C first to make this work. This can be done in a couple of ways, either as described at <https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#enable-i2c> or use the HassOS I2C Configurator from <https://github.com/adamoutler/HassOSConfigurator>.
